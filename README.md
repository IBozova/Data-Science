# Data-Science
In this repo I have included my assignments from the 2 course I successfully passed out of the 4 of the AI module I am currently taking.\
The starting one, called Math for Devs, is matematically orientated course in which math concepts as noted below are coded instead of calculated:\
• Calculus\
• Linear Algebra\
• Probability and combinatorics\
• Statistics\
• Hypothesys Testing\
\
The second course is Data Science which is more statistically oriented and encompases topics like:\
• Data Manipulation\
• Data Visualization\
• Exploratory Data Analisys\
• Regression Models\
This course also expands on the knowledge of the previous with more practical exercises aimed to show how we can prepare data using the matematical concepts mentioned above before the analysis phase/applying a suitable  algorithm.

The exercises are using Python as main language and it utilizes libraries such as: \
• Simpy\
• Numpy\
• Matplotlib\
• scikits.learn\
• Scikit-image\
• geopandas\
• turtle
